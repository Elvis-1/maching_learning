1. Practice Decomposition
Start by breaking EVERY problem into smaller pieces:

Inputs: What data do I have?

Outputs: What should I produce?

Process: What transformations happen in between?

Constraints: What are the limits and rules?

Exercise: Take simple daily problems and decompose them:

"How to plan a trip" → transportation + accommodation + activities

"How to cook a meal" → ingredients + steps + timing

2. Learn Pattern Recognition
Common programming patterns appear everywhere:

Data processing pipelines (like this AFL problem)

Graph/tree traversals

Search and sorting problems

State machines

Simulation problems

Practice: Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, but focus on categorizing them by pattern.


Applied to Our AFL Problem

Let me show you how I'd teach someone to analyze it:

Student: "I don't know where to start!"
Me: "Let's ask questions:

What's the goal? "Rank teams and find top 2"

What data do we have? "Teams, who plays whom, scores"

How do we rank? "Points then percentage"

What could go wrong? "Bad data, missing teams, invalid scores"

See? Just asking the right questions gets you 80% there."
